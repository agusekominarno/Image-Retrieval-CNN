![Result](image/result.png)

## Abstract
This project focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to enhance the retrieval of batik images, an integral part of cultural heritage preservation. It employs a tailored CNN model to accurately extract visual features and perform image matching using the Batik Nitik 960 dataset, consisting of 960 distinct Nitik batik patterns. The model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying and retrieving visually similar batik patterns, highlighting the potential of CNNs in understanding and accessing cultural heritage.
